# watch-a-movie
an attempt to create a website to download any movie with torrents available, directly from the browser.

## note:
what is most likely more than 50% of the torrents found by the website have little to no websocket seeders, which make the website somehow useless.
recent movies that were only recently available at torrent databases usually have enough websocket seeders to download it entirely at a reasonable speed.
